Click on the “Download ZIP” button. Once unzipped, there will be two directories titled “Game” and “Scripts”. The “Scripts” directory contains all of the code script files that were used in the project. To run the game, navigate to the “Game” directory and open the “Rabby’s_Carrots.exe” file. After that, a small window titled “3D Platformer Configuration” should pop up. It is recommended that the dropdown next to “Screen resolution” is set to the highest possible value. From there, click on the “Play!” button to open the game.

Once the game is opened, there will be a title screen. Select the “PLAY” button to play the game, or the “EXIT” button to return to your desktop. At any point in the game after pressing “PLAY”, you can press either the “ESCAPE” or “P” keys to pause the game. After pausing the game, you can click on the “RESUME” button to keep playing, or the “QUIT” button to end the game.
